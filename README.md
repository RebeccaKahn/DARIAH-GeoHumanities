# About

The DARIAH Geohumanities Working Group is devoted to bringing together scholars and practitioners in the field of GeoHumanities. 

#What are the Geohumanities?
GeoHumanities is the discipline which has emerged out of the 'spatial turn' in the social sciences and humanities since the 1990s. This turn has resulted in the reconsideration of space as an important phenomenon in the constitution of social life - or, put another way: everything happens somewhere. And Geohumanities are concerend with exploring the where. 
Geohumanities knowledge has become a key component in the theory and practice of social sciences and humanities. As a fully-fledged domain, geohumanities now benefits from the rapidly proliferating interaction between the disciplines of humanities, social sciences and geography and is continuously spurred on by fruitful challenges from the developments in digital technologies. In fact, digital technology is an important component of the geohumanities, which has also brought the discipline into the real of the digital humanities.

In order to help make sense of this proliferation and the many tools, methods and theoretical approaches that have emerged out of it, the Working Group has developed a set of freely available, high-quality teaching resources for digital geohumanities practices and research methodologies. They have been designed for use by undergraduate and post-graduate students, scholars and other interested parties who want to explore the new developments in and possibilities provided by the field of geohumanities in the age of digital media.

## What's in here?
This is the repository for the learning and teaching modules developed by the DARIAH Geohumanities working group. Each module has a central themeand consists of introductory materials, suggested readings and other resources (such as video tutorials), suggested tools and how-tos.

## Using the Modules
Each module has been designed in a way that allows it be used as the basis of a stand-alone, once-off session (such as a single seminar).
Or, if you prefer, several of the modules can be used together, to create a syllabus for a longer period, such as a semester. 
You could also break a module into its component parts, and use them as the basis for individual teaching sessions, 
such as a hands-on seminar based on using a particular tool. 
We encourage you to mix-and-match!

## Our Sources
There a many, many excellent geohumanities resources online. Some have been developed by historians, others by classicists, geographers, literary scholars or data scientists. Their value lies in their interdisciplinary application. As far as possible, we have tried to curate the resources in a way that makes use of this diversity, so that the materials are appropriate and applicable to as many people as possible. Wherever possible we have used materials and tools that are open source and free to usem share and adapt.
