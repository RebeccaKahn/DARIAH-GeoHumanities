# DARIAH-GeoHumanities

# What's in here?
This is the repository for the learning and teaching modules developed by the DARIAH Geohumanities working group. Each module has a central thems
and consists of introductory materials, suggested readings and other resources (such as video tutorials), suggested tools and how-tos.

# Using the Modules
Each module has been designed in a way that allows it be used as a stand-alone, once-off session (such as a seminar) covering a particular theme. 
Or, if you prefer, several of the modules can be used together, to create a syllabus for a longer period, such as a semester. 
You could also break a module into its component parts, and use them as the basis for individual teaching sessions, 
such as a hands-on seminar based on using a particular tool. 
We encourage you to mix-and-match!
